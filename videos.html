        <h1>Our Reviews:</h1>
        <section class='container-review'>

            <h2>gangnam tofu - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br> 2/5 the gangnam chicken was extremely greasy to the point there was oil coming out of it as i took a bite. The tofu soup was not my type of dish it was filled with many seafoods which is not my preference. We also got the bulgogi which is a marinated beef dish which was very good and was the highlight of the restaurant for me due to its strong flavors.</p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 2.5/5 Overall, this restaurant was okay at best. The chicken was not that good and I feel like it could have been a bit more flavorful. I enjoyed the tofu soup, there was nothing special about it but also nothing wrong with it. The bulgogi had a very strong yet subtle taste, very good. </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br> 2/5 I only really liked the tofu soup and I wasn't a big fan of anything else. We really started this with a great resturant! </p>
        
            <h2>gen bbq - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br> 3/5 The food was as expected to be we had a plethora of options which made us try new things which we were not completely happy with when we were done cooking them.  </p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 3.5/5 It did not hit as much as it used too. My first Gen experience was great and I loved everything. But, this time it wasn‚Äôt as good as before. Still recommend for people who haven't tried it before though!  </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br>  2/5 The meat was very raw. But in all seriousness, this place is better when you are very hungry and have a lot of people with you. I would recommend this place if you're a fan of AYCE Korean BBQs.</p>
        
            <h2>yojimbo - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br> 7/5 This place was honestly somewhere where i will never forget dining at due to there extremely (????????????) design. The dishes all 3 of us ordered were very good even for it being my first time trying ramen i was more surprised then i thought i would be. The food was at a lower then expected price due to the overall quality of the dish </p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 5/5 I loved this place. At first glance, it may look odd because the entrance looks like a kitchen but after that part the environment and scenery of the area is amazing. There were paintings and pieces of art hung all over the walls. It created a nice aesthetic vibe to the place. MY ramen was amazing and there it came with a lot noodles. It was great value for the price.  </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br> 5/5 the environment was amazing and so was my ‚Äúbland‚Äù ramen. And with this place being in Alameda, there are plenty of things to do after you eat, like go to the shoreline or even get the many dessert shops around the area. Overall, this place is amazing and its location is just great too.</p>
        
            <h2>bonchan - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br>4.5/5 the wings are really good and come at a cheap price for the high quality of meat and preperarion of the wing. </p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 5/5 One of the best wings establishment I have been too. The Wings come in large portions and have a very great taste. The wings only come in two styles, the soy garlic and the spicy. They are roughly around $38 for for 30 wings. I think that the quality of the wings is good for the cost. </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br> 4.5/5 Well their wings are fantastic. Great quality and very huge for a wing. Compared to wingstop and other wing places, these wings are like the "x-model" of wings. Overall, great place and would reccomend to anyone. </p>
        
         
            <h2>zaiqa - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br> 4/5 the food was served in a buffet style which had 8 entress and two types of rice and naan (bread) accompanied with it. All of the dishes were fresh and hot. The interior of the restaurant wasn't anything amazing but the service was good we never had to ask them for anything (water, naan,).</p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 4.5/5 I think that this restaurant was splendid. We were served the all you can eat buffet for $12. There was a decent amount of options to choose from. All of the dishes were really good and tasted very fresh. The service was fairly good and they paid attention to us, they gave us water and refills on the naan bread. Overall, a nice experience and I recommend. </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br> 4/5 I've like only been to one other Indian buffet place and if I remember correctly, I hated that place. The only thing I liked there was the naan and the mango lassi. This place overall was just better and the food here tasted great. Everything feels like a "home" because you have to go up and get your own food. </p>
