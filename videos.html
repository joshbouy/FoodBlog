            <h2>gangnam tofu - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br> 2/5 the gangnam chicken was extremely greasy to the point there was oil coming out of it as i took a bite. The tofu soup was not my type of dish it was filled with many seafoods which is not my preference. We also got the bulgogi which is a marinated beef dish which was very good and was the highlight of the restaurant for me due to its strong flavors.</p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 2.5/5 Overall, this restaurant was okay at best. The chicken was not that good and I feel like it could have been a bit more flavorful. I enjoyed the tofu soup, there was nothing special about it but also nothing wrong with it. The bulgogi had a very strong yet subtle taste, very good. </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br> 2/5 I only really liked the tofu soup and I wasn't a big fan of anything else. We really started this with a great resturant! </p>
        
            <h2>gen bbq - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br> 3/5 The food was as expected to be we had a plethora of options which made us try new things which we were not completely happy with when we were done cooking them.  </p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 3.5/5 It did not hit as much as it used too. My first Gen experience was great and I loved everything. But, this time it wasn‚Äôt as good as before. Still recommend for people who haven't tried it before though!  </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br>  2/5 The meat was very raw. But in all seriousness, this place is better when you are very hungry and have a lot of people with you. I would recommend this place if you're a fan of AYCE Korean BBQs.</p>
        
            <h2>yojimbo - </h2>
            <p><b>Aslum:</b> <br> 7/5 This place was honestly somewhere where i will never forget dining at due to there extremely (????????????) design. The dishes all 3 of us ordered were very good even for it being my first time trying ramen i was more surprised then i thought i would be. The food was at a lower then expected price due to the overall quality of the dish </p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> <br> 5/5 I loved this place. At first glance, it may look odd because the entrance looks like a kitchen but after that part the environment and scenery of the area is amazing. There were paintings and pieces of art hung all over the walls. It created a nice aesthetic vibe to the place. MY ramen was amazing and there it came with a lot noodles. It was great value for the price.  </p>
            <p><b>Josh:</b> <br> 5/5 the environment was amazing and so was my ‚Äúbland‚Äù ramen. And with this place being in Alameda, there are plenty of things to do after you eat, like go to the shoreline or even get the many dessert shops around the area. Overall, this place is amazing and its location is just great too.</p>
